   - Improved column visibility persistence
   - Better modal state management
   - Fixed column header titles in persons section
   - Added column resizing functionality to persons table
   - Standardized column management across sections
   - Improved column state persistence with section-specific keys

6. Enhanced favorites system:

   - Search clears automatically when input is empty.

## Known Issues
None currently identified (Team tab issues resolved)

## Next Steps
1. Monitor for any UI/UX issues
2. Consider implementing column order persistence
3. Look for performance optimization opportunities (e.g., search-as-you-type)
4. Consider adding column width persistence
5. Plan for advanced filtering features
6. Consider adding search within saved searches
7. Consider adding bulk actions for saved searches
8. Consider adding visual indicator for active filters
9. Extend saved filter application to other sections as needed

## Technical Debt
- Consider refactoring table components for better reusability
- Review state management patterns
- Consider implementing proper test coverage
- Document component APIs
