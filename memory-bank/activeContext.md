# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
- Monitoring application stability and performance after recent updates
- Planning next steps based on user feedback and project priorities

## Recent Changes

### Saved Filters Application
- Fixed issue with saved filters not being properly applied in /persons section
- Added support for saved filters in /companies section
- Improved filter parameter propagation from parent components to data hooks
- Enhanced debugging with detailed logging for filter parameters and API requests
- Ensured proper URL synchronization when applying filters

### Table Column Management
- Moved Columns button from table header to search bar area in both /companies and /persons sections
- Integrated with other action buttons (Filters, Save Search, Add to Favorites)
- Implemented column state persistence across page changes
- Added column visibility modal with proper state management
- Fixed column header titles to match actual content in /persons section
- Improved column management in /persons section to match /companies functionality
- Added Settings icon to Columns button for visual consistency
- Enhanced column resizing functionality in /persons table

### Favorites System
- Fixed favorites display discrepancy between sidebar and main view
- Updated favorites section labels from "Contacts" to "Persons" for consistency
- Improved favorites synchronization between components

### Search Functionality (/companies)
- Implemented search-as-you-type in `CompaniesSearchBar.tsx`.
- Search triggers automatically after 300ms debounce when input length >= 3.
- Search clears automatically when input is empty.

### Company Profile Team Tab (/company/:id)
- Updated `useTeamMembers.ts` hook to fetch data using `fetchFilteredContacts` from `contactsService.ts`, replacing the deprecated Xano endpoint and resolving CORS errors.
- Fixed incorrect profile links in `TeamMemberCard.tsx` by using `contact.contact_id` instead of `contact.id`.
- Resolved React key warning in `CompanyTeamTab.tsx` by using `member.contact_id` as the key.

### Saved Filters Application
- Fixed issue with saved filters not being properly applied in /persons section
- Added support for saved filters in /companies section
- Improved filter parameter propagation from parent components to data hooks
- Enhanced debugging with detailed logging for filter parameters and API requests
- Ensured proper URL synchronization when applying filters

### Table Column Management
- Moved Columns button from table header to search bar area
- Integrated with other action buttons (Filters, Save Search, Add to Favorites)
- Implemented column state persistence across page changes
- Added column visibility modal with proper state management

### Favorites System
- Fixed favorites display discrepancy between sidebar and main view
- Updated favorites section labels from "Contacts" to "Persons" for consistency
- Improved favorites synchronization between components

### UI Improvements
- Standardized button placement in search bar
- Removed redundant spacing in table layout
- Improved visual consistency of action buttons
- /persons: skeleton loader now matches table height for current pagination (like /companies)
- /persons: empty state fully disabled, no flicker or placeholder before data
- Removed all "lovable" branding and references
- Restored original sidebar logo

## Active Decisions

### Filter Application
- Filter state is managed at the parent level (PersonalCabinet3/Companies components)
- Filter changes are propagated to child components via props and callbacks
- Local filter state in list components is synchronized with parent props
- API parameters are mapped correctly from UI filter fields
- Page is reset to 1 when applying filters to ensure results are visible

### Column Management
- Column state is managed at the list level (CompaniesList component)
- Column preferences are persisted using localStorage
- Modal state is controlled by parent component
- Name column is always visible and cannot be disabled

### Component Structure
- Search bar contains all main actions (search, filters, columns, favorites)
- Table focuses on data display and row interactions
- Column modal handles visibility toggles and column order

## Current Patterns
- State lifting for shared functionality
- Consistent button styling and placement
- Persistent user preferences
- Clear component responsibilities
- Type-based grouping for lists (Companies/Persons)
- Consistent navigation patterns based on content type
- Proper filter state propagation through component hierarchy
- URL synchronization with application state

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring for any UI/UX issues
- Consider adding column order persistence
- Look for opportunities to improve table performance
- Consider adding column width persistence
- Consider adding search filters to saved searches display
- Extend saved filter application to other sections as needed
- Consider adding visual indicator for active filters
- Evaluate performance impact of search-as-you-type

## Known Issues
- None currently identified (Team tab issues resolved)

## Recent Learnings
- Importance of consistent button placement
- Benefits of lifting state management
- Value of persistent user preferences
- Effectiveness of type-based content organization
- Benefits of consistent navigation patterns
- Importance of proper state propagation through component hierarchy
- Value of detailed logging for debugging complex state flows
- Benefits of URL synchronization with application state
