# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
- Improving table functionality and user experience in the companies section
- Enhancing column management and persistence
- Fixing UI/UX issues with table controls

## Recent Changes

### Table Column Management
- Moved Columns button from table header to search bar area
- Integrated with other action buttons (Filters, Save Search, Add to Favorites)
- Implemented column state persistence across page changes
- Added column visibility modal with proper state management

### Favorites System
- Fixed favorites display discrepancy between sidebar and main view
- Updated favorites section labels from "Contacts" to "Persons" for consistency
- Improved favorites synchronization between components

### UI Improvements
- Standardized button placement in search bar
- Removed redundant spacing in table layout

## Active Decisions

### Column Management
- Column state is managed at the list level (CompaniesList component)
- Column preferences are persisted using localStorage
- Modal state is controlled by parent component
- Name column is always visible and cannot be disabled

### Component Structure
- Search bar contains all main actions (search, filters, columns, favorites)
- Table focuses on data display and row interactions
- Column modal handles visibility toggles and column order

## Current Patterns
- State lifting for shared functionality
- Consistent button styling and placement
- Persistent user preferences
- Clear component responsibilities
- Type-based grouping for lists (Companies/Persons)
- Consistent navigation patterns based on content type

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring for any UI/UX issues
- Consider adding column order persistence
- Look for opportunities to improve table performance
- Consider adding column width persistence
- Consider adding search filters to saved searches display

## Known Issues
- None currently identified

## Recent Learnings
- Importance of consistent button placement
- Benefits of lifting state management
- Value of persistent user preferences
- Effectiveness of type-based content organization
- Benefits of consistent navigation patterns
